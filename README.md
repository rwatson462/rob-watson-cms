# rob-watson-cms

Designed to run on a different server (a Docker container on localhost) to the
main website for security purposes.  It will output template files and populate
databases to service the main website.

## Goals:
1. Specific

  management system that anyone can use.
2. Lightweight

3. Does the processing a main website would usually do
> The CMS will "compile" articles and other pages into as simple a form as
  possible and saved as template files for the website.
4. Demonstrative

  what I can do, and will be full of comments supporting design decisions
  and explaining processes along the way.
